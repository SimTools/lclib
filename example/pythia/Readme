This directory includes PYTHIA55 + JCL Simulator.  See Makefile in
this directory about how to create executable program.

A commadn, make, creates the executable module, pythia.ex.
The pythia.ex includes 
   (1) PYTHIA event generator, including interface routine.
   (2) List routine for Generator:Particle_List bank.
   (3) Partcile swimmer
   (4) Signal smearing 
as FULL modules.  These are declared in the FLANLI.f in this
directory.

Typical input data are prepared;
  ftn05.qq500gev   ; e+e- --> f+fbar at 500 GeV.
  ftn05.ww500gev   ; e+e- --> W+W- at 500 GeV.
  ftn05.ww1tev   ; e+e- --> W+W- at 1 TeV.
  ftn05.zh110gev.300gev ; e+e- --> ZH at 300 GeV with mh=110GeV.
  ftn05.mnjcc.58gev ; ccbar production by two-photon interaction at 58GeV.

To run program, do
  pythia.ex < ftn05.qq500gev > jobout.qq500gev &

In this example, the process is executed as a "batch" job.  
Jobout put is written in a file, jobout.qq500gev, which is
also in this directory.

<<<<<< Special Notice >>>>>>>
When I tested the program, jetset library in the standard CERNLIB
directory seemed wrong, because I saw the error even I run 
the sample program, PYTEST.  Therefore, I installed the PYTHIA55
and LUND73 program obtained from FACOM MSP, which was installed
there by AMY group.  Makefile is coded so that to refer this
version of PYTHIA55 and JETSET73, and the program is checked
to run without printing error message  only for the parameter 
sets given by ftn05.* files.  So, please watch your out put
carefully, when you make your own analysis.
